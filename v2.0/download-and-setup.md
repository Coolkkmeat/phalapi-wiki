        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }

    access_log logs/dev.phalapi.net.access.log;
    error_log logs/dev.phalapi.net.error.log;
}

### Apache Configuration

If you are using Nginx, you can refer to the following configuration. Folder structure:
```
htdocs
├── phalapi
└── .htaccess
```

Content of ".htaccess":

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteBase /

    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^dev.phalapi.net$

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/phalapi/public/
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /phalapi/public/$1
    RewriteRule ^(/)?$ index.php [L]
</IfModule>
```

### XAMPP Configuration

    "data": {
        "title": "Hello PhalApi",
        "version": "2.0.1",
        "time": 1501079142

## How to upgrade PhalApi 2.x framework？

Under composer environment, it is very simple to upgrade the PhalApi 2.x framework. Just modify the composer.json file and specify the corresponding version.
PhalApi's framework kernel project is at[phalapi/kernal](https://github.com/phalapi/kernal), You can specify the version, or you can follow the latest version.

For example, when you need to specify PhalApi version 2.0.1, you can configure it like this:
```
{
    "require": {
        "phalapi/kernal": "2.0.1"
    }
}
```

When you need to keep the latest version, you can change to:
```
{
    "require": {
        "phalapi/kernal": "2.*.*"
    }
}
```

In this way, when PhalApi 2.x is updated, you only need to perform the composer update operation. The corresponding command operation is:

```bash
$ composer update
```

By now, the upgrade is complete!
