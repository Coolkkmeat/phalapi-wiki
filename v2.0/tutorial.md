## What is PhalApi 2.x？

PhalApi, referred to as π Framework, is a lightweight PHP open source API framework, focusing on API development and striving to make API development easier:

 + Committing to fast, stable and continuous delivery of valuable API services.
 + Focusing on test-driven development, domain-driven design, extreme programming, agile development.
 + Supporting many extended class libraries to provide efficient and convenient solutions together with more open source projects.
 + Supporting protocols including HTTP / SOAP / RPC / etc.
 + Easy to build interfaces / microservices / RESTful API / Web Services.


PhalApi currently has two major series versions. The 1.x series version, which mainly uses a more ancient and traditional approach; The main differences are:


 + Use [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage all the dependencies.
 + Introduce Namespace concept.
 + Obey [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/) Regulation.

> Reminder: In this development document, unless otherwise specified, PhalApi means both PhalApi 1.x version and PhalApi 2.x version.

## Features

PhalApi is a super cool open source framework. The more you know about it, the more you can discover its coolness. Here are some key features.

### Feature 1: Low learning cost

PhalApi always adheres to the KISS principle, and follows the principle of least innovation in the Unix philosophy. In addition to following international conventions and adopting a common practice, PhalApi also gives priority to the schemes that everyone is familiar with when designing. For example, the format of the API return result is everyone-known JSON format. For junior developers who are new to the PHP programming language, or even client developers who have not previously encountered PHP, according to previous learning experience, in most cases, you can complete the basic learning of the PhalApi framework within one week. And put into the actual project development.

### Feature 2: Automatically generated online API documentation

After coding in the format specified by the framework, PhalApi will automatically generate the Online API List Document and Online API Detail Document to facilitate the client to view the latest interface signature and return fields in real time.

There are two main types of automatically generated online documents:

### Feature 3: Numerous reusable extension libraries  

The PhalApi framework extension class library is an independent, reusable component or class library that can be directly integrated into a PhalApi development project, so that project developers can feel the joy of building block-like programming and reduce development costs.

By now, there are 40+ extension class libraries provided, including: WeChat Public Platform Development extension, WeChat Mini Program Development extension, Payment extension, File Upload extension, Excel form and Word document extension.

> Tips: Some extension libraries need to be adjusted and ported to PhalApi 2.x style to use.


### Feature 4: Active open source community

PhalApi is not a "our's" framework, but an open source framework for everyone of us. The PhalApi open source community is very active, except for a real-time communication group of 1000+ people, we alos have Q&A community (http://qa.phalapi.net/), there are hundreds and thousands of developers' contribution.  

The learning materials of PhalApi 2.x are still being added one after another, you can refer to the learning materials of PhalApi 1.x series. Including：[Development Documentation](https://www.phalapi.net/wikis/)、[Video Tutorial](https://www.phalapi.net/wikis/8-1.html)、["Get to know PhalApi"Free Ebook](http://www.ituring.com.cn/book/2405)、[Blog Article](https://my.oschina.net/wenzhenxi/blog?catalog=3363506)等.  

## Applicable scene and environment

All of PhalApi's code, products, and ideas are open source, please feel free to use.

The applicable scenarios of PhalApi include, but are not limited to:

 + Provide API services for mobile apps (including iOS, iPad, Android, Windows Phone and other terminals).
 + Uses to build API platform system, provide aggregate interface services for other back-end systems.
 + Provides Ajax asynchronous interface for H5 mixed page application with front and back separation.

For the three cases of architecture independence, focus on architecture and improvement of architecture, PhalApi also can do!

Just like other responsible open source frameworks, PhlaApi also has occasions when it is not suitable to use. These include but are not limited to:

 + Develop CLI projects (but have provided support for command line project development[CLI Extension Class Library](http://git.oschina.net/dogstar/PhalApi-Library/tree/master/CLI)）
 + Develop a website project, that is, interface display and view rendering ( but [View extension class library that supports view rendering has been provided](http://git.oschina.net/dogstar/PhalApi-Library/tree/master/View)）
 + High requirements for data rigor, such as financial industry related projects, after all, PHP is a weakly typed language.

## Intended audience of this document  

 + Developers who are new to PhalApi framework.
 + Developers who are doing projects under PhalApi framework.
 + Anyone who wants to learn a useful and easy API framework.
 + Managers who are looking for an excelent API framework for their project.
